# discord-rich-presence-command-line

> I used the Discord Rich Presence C++ Lib ([here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to)) 
given by Discord and made this tool using some efforts.

This project is also using the [rapidJSON library](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson)

and it has been wrapped into a installator with NSIS
